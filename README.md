GitHub Actions Development Tools in Python.

## Install

```
pip install actionspytoolkit
```

## Introduction

This package allows the developer to write entry points for their Dockerized GitHub Action in Python, rather than in shell (or whatever else). Right now this package is super simple, and only wraps the commands [documented here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/development-tools-for-github-actions).

## Example

Coming Soon
